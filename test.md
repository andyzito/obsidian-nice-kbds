## Here is ⌘ + A a shortcut in a heading

Here is a shortcut Ctrl + B + Q in normal text and another one ⌘ + A and then one in a link [ahem ⌘⇧ + Z ahem](https://www.google.com)

- Here is a shortcut ⌘ + B in a bullet list and again ⌘ + A, okay?

1. Here ⌘ + N is a shortcut in a numbered list! (and italics *⌘ + A* and bold **⌘ + A**)

> Here ⌘ + A is a shortcut in a quote

> [!NOTE] Here is a ⌘ + A shortcut in a callout title
> And in callout ⌘ + A contents



```
There should NOT be ⌘ + A shortcuts in a code block.
```

`Nor in an inline ⌘ + A code block.`
