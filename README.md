# Nice KBDs

This Obsidian plugin automatically detects keyboard shortcuts and wraps them in <kbd> tags. For example, âŒ˜ + A becomes <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>, making keyboard combinations clear and visually distinct (styles included).

Additionally, this plugin introduces a unique Markdown syntax for manually specifying keyboard inputs. Using configurable wrapper characters, you can indicate key combos, like `Â«CMDÂ»` <kbd>CMD</kbd>.

## Auto Matching

This plugin assumes that:
- Key combos start with an identifiable 'key' (e.g. 'Ctrl', 'âŒ˜', 'â‡§'), which may be followed by any number of allowed characters.
- Key combos may contain additional keys separated by a plus sign ('+').
- Additional keys may include any allowed characters and do not have to start with an identifiable 'key'.

Examples:
- âŒ˜â‡§A
- Ctrl+Shift+A
- âŒ˜ + âŒ¥ + F12

## Markdown Syntax

You may force a `<kbd>` by using the `Â«Â»` syntax. These wrapper characters are configurable.

This functionality works interoperably with the auto matching. Examples:
- Â«âŒ˜â‡§AÂ»
- Â«CtrlÂ» + Â«ShiftÂ» Â«+AÂ»
- Â«CMDÂ» + OPT + F12

## Known Issues

- Trigger words should be stricter about word boundary, e.g., `Ctrl~` should not trigger a key combo.
- Backtick matching should be stricter, 'âŒ˜ + \\`' still comes out weird. Might just be a Markdown limitation though.
