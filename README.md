# Nice KBDs

`<kbd>` is the HTML tag for keyboard input. It's useful for showing keyboard shortcuts in documentation. This plugin automatically adds the `<kbd>` tag to any text that matches the pattern of a keyboard shortcut/combo. It also provides a new Markdown syntax (wrapper characters configurable) for indicating key combos: `«CMD»`. Prettier styles are also included.

## Auto Matching

This plugin assumes that:
- Key combos start with an identifiable 'key' (e.g. 'Ctrl', '⌘', '⇧'), which may be followed by any number of allowed characters.
- Key combos may contain additional keys separated by a plus sign ('+').
- Additional keys may include any allowed characters and do not have to start with an identifiable 'key'.

Examples:
- ⌘⇧A
- Ctrl+Shift+A
- ⌘ + ⌥ + F12

## Markdown Syntax

You may force a `<kbd>` by using the `«»` syntax. These wrapper characters are configurable.

This functionality should integrate seamlessly with the auto matching. Examples:
- «⌘⇧A»
- «Ctrl» + «Shift» «+A»
- «CMD» + OPT + F12

## Known Issues

- Trigger words should be stricter about word boundary, e.g., `Ctrl~` should not trigger a key combo.
- Some characters should probably be restricted to being on their own in a key, such as `[.,)]`, so that `(Ctrl+D)` wraps only the `Ctrl+D` part (currently it would wrap `Ctrl+D)`).
