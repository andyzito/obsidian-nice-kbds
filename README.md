# Nice KBDs

`<kbd>` is the HTML tag for keyboard input. It's useful for showing keyboard shortcuts in documentation. This plugin automatically adds the `<kbd>` tag to any text that matches the pattern of a keyboard shortcut.

This plugin assumes that keyboard shortcuts start with an identifiable key (e.g. 'Ctrl', 'âŒ˜', 'â‡§') and may contain following keys, potentially separated by a plus sign ('+'). E.g.:
- âŒ˜â‡§A
- Ctrl+Shift+A
- âŒ˜ + âŒ¥ + F12
